== Setting up

Refer to the guide <<SettingUp#, here>>.

== Design

[[Design-Architecture]]
=== Architecture

.Architecture Diagram
image::ArchitectureDiagram.svg[]

The *_Architecture Diagram_* given above explains the high-level design of the App. Given below is a quick overview of each component.

[TIP]
The `.puml` files used to create diagrams in this document can be found in the link:{repoURL}/docs/diagrams/[diagrams] folder.
Refer to the <<UsingPlantUml#, Using PlantUML guide>> to learn how to create and edit diagrams.

`Main` has two classes called link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/Main.java[`Main`] and link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java[`MainApp`]. It is responsible for,

* At app launch: Initializes the components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down: Shuts down the components and invokes cleanup method where necessary.

<<Design-Commons,*`Commons`*>> represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.
The following class plays an important role at the architecture level:

* `LogsCenter` : Used by many classes to write log messages to the App's log file.

The rest of the App consists of four components.

* <<Design-Ui,*`UI`*>>: The UI of the App.
* <<Design-Logic,*`Logic`*>>: The command executor.
* <<Design-Model,*`Model`*>>: Holds the data of the App in-memory.
* <<Design-Storage,*`Storage`*>>: Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.

Each of the four components

* Defines its _API_ in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* Exposes its functionality using a `{Component Name}Manager` class.

For example, the `Logic` component (see the class diagram given below) defines it's API in the `Logic.java` interface and exposes its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class.

.Class Diagram of the Logic Component

[discrete]
==== How the architecture components interact with each other

The _Sequence Diagram_ below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues the command `delete -o 1`.

.Component interactions for `delete -o 1` command
image::ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.svg[]

The sections below give more details of each component.

[[Design-Ui]]
=== UI component

.Structure of the UI Component
image::UiClassDiagram.svg[]

*API* : link:{repoURL}/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/Ui.java[`Ui.java`]

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `PersonListPanel`, `StatusBarFooter` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class.

The `UI` component uses JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the link:{repoURL}/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java[`MainWindow`] is specified in link:{repoURL}/blob/master/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml[`MainWindow.fxml`]

The `UI` component,

* Executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* Listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.

[[Design-Logic]]
=== Logic component

[[fig-LogicClassDiagram]]
.Structure of the Logic Component
image::LogicClassDiagram.svg[]

*API* :
link:{repoURL}/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/Logic.java[`Logic.java`]

.  `Logic` uses the `OrderBookParser` class to parse the user command.
.  This results in a `Command` object which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
.  The command execution can affect the `Model` (e.g. adding a new order).
.  The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is passed back to the `Ui`.
.  In addition, the `CommandResult` object can also instruct the `Ui` to perform certain actions, such as displaying help to the user.

Given below is the Sequence Diagram for interactions within the `Logic` component for the `execute("delete -o 1")` API call.

.Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete -o 1` Command
image::DeleteSequenceDiagram.svg[]

NOTE: The lifeline for `DeleteCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.

[[Design-Model]]
=== Model component

.Structure of the Model Component
image::ModelClassDiagram.svg[]

*API* : link:{repoURL}/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java[`Model.java`]

The `Model`,

* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the user's preferences.
* stores the Order Book data.
* exposes an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Order>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* does not depend on any of the other three components.

[NOTE]
An Order class consists of nine different fields as shown in the image. Every order is part of a UniqueOrderList and
every UniqueOrderList is part of an OrderBook.
image:BetterModelClassDiagram.svg[]

//tag::Design-Storage[]
[[Design-Storage]]
=== Storage component

.Structure of the Storage Component
image::StorageClassDiagram.svg[]

*API* : link:{repoURL}/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/Storage.java[`Storage.java`]

The `Storage` component,

* can save `UserPref` objects in json format and read it back.
* can save both OrderBook and ReturnOrderBook data in json format and read it back.
//end::Design-Storage[]

[[Design-Commons]]
=== Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.addressbook.commons` package.

== Implementation

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

[[insert]]
=== Insert Feature
This section, will <<what-is-insert, introduce>> the Insert Feature. In addition, it will show the expected
<<insert-sequence, path-execution>>, the <<insert-class, structure>> of the of the *InsertCommand* class,
<<insertparser-class, structure>> of the *InsertCommandParser* class and
it will also describe the <<insert-activity, interaction>> of objects between the *InsertCommand* object and other object classes.

[[what-is-insert]]
==== What is the Insert feature
The insert feature allows the user to insert an incoming delivery order into the list using the command line.
The order consists of : Transaction ID, Name, Phone, Address, Email, Delivery Timestamp, Warehouse location,
CashOnDelivery

The order also consists of two optional fields that can be added:

. Type of Item

. Comment for Courier

[[insert-class]]
==== Structure of Insert feature

[[insertparser-class]]
==== Structure of InsertCommandParser
.InsertCommandParser Class Diagram
image::InsertParserClassDiagram.svg[]

[[insert-activity]]
==== Path Execution of Insert Command
.Insert Activity Diagram
image::InsertActivityDiagram.svg[]

[[insert-sequence]]
==== Interaction between objects when the *Insert Command* is executed
Here is the sequence diagram for the *Insert Command* as shown below: +

.Insert
image::InsertCommandSequenceDiagram.svg[]

The arguments of the Insert Command will be parsed using the parse method of the `InsertCommandParser` class. +
The `InsertCommandParser` will tokenize the arguments parsed in using the tokenize method of `ArgumentTokenizer` class which
returns the tokenized arguments. Using the tokenized arguments, the Parser will check if the arguments parsed in matches with the
tokenized arguments using the arePrefixesPresent method.

There are two scenarios : +

. Some compulsory prefixes are not present : +
`InsertCommandParser` will throw a new `ParseException` object to the `LogicManager`.

. All compulsory prefixes are present in the arguments : +
It will the  proceed to use the getValue method of the `ArgumentMultimap` class to get the value of the prefix. For example,
if the argument parsed in is tid/A12345, the getValue method will get the value 'A12345'. Subsequently, it will use the
`ParseUtil` methods to get the corresponding object values and put it into the parameters of the new `Order` object.
The order object will be put into the parameter of the `InsertCommand` object and this will be returned
to the `LogicManager` class for execution.

`LogicManager` will call the execute() method of this `InsertCommand` object. In the execute() method, it will use the `Model` class
to call hasOrder method to check for duplicates, if it is a duplicate, the order will throw a CommandException which
indicates that there is a duplicate order in the OrderBook already. Else, it will successfully inserts the new order
using addOder method. Finally, it return a new `CommandResult` object, containing a String that indicates a successful
insertion.

[[list]]
=== List feature
This section describes the <<list-functionality, functionality>> , the <<list-structure, structure>>,
<<list-interactions, interactions>> between objects and <<list-path, path>> the path execution of the *List Command*.

[[list-functionality]]
==== What is the List feature
List feature allows the user to see all the orders from both Delivery Orders and Return Orders.

The user can enter `list` to display all the orders. Besides that, the user can also input `done` to dispay
all delivered orders and `undone` to display all orders that are not delivered.

[[list-structure]]
==== Structure List feature
The structure of the List Feature is as shown below:

.List Class Diagram
image::ListClassDiagram.svg[]

[[list-path]]
==== Path execution of the List Command
.List Activity Diagram
image::ListActivityDiagram.svg[]

The above activity diagram shows the logic and the path execution when the *List Command* is executed.

[[list-interactions]]
==== Interaction between objects during execution of List Command
The sequence diagram for the *List Command* is shown below: +

.List Command Sequence Diagram
image::ListCommandSequenceDiagram.svg[]

The user first calls the command "list".
[NOTE]
====
The second argument of the `list` command can be `done` or `undone` or an empty String.
====

The LogicManager will call the parseCommand method of OrderBookParser, which then passes the second argument
the second argument into the `ListCommand` object. This object will then be ultimately returned to the `LogicManager`.
Next, the `LogicManager` will call the execute(model) method using the `ListCommand` object. In this method, it wil use
the `Model` object to call the methods : updateFilteredOrderList and updateFilteredReturnOrderList. Since in this case, the
argument is empty, the predicate that is parsed to the two methods will always result to true, which means to list
everything from the order book and return book. When completed, the execute(model) will return a `CommandResult` object
to the `LogicManager`, indicating that the command execution is a success.

//tag::clear[]

=== Clear feature
In this section, the <<what-is-clear, functionality>> of the `clear` feature, the expected <<clear-execution-path, execution path>>,
the <<clear-structure, structure>> of the `ClearCommand` class and the <<clear-interaction, interactions>>
between objects with the `ClearCommand` object will be discussed.

[[what-is-clear]]
==== What is the Clear feature
The `clear` feature was implemented as a `ClearCommand` in the `logic` package. +
The `clear` feature allows the user to remove the orders and return orders by input one command line. +

[[clear-execution-path]]
==== Execution paths of Clear Command
The execution path of the `ClearCommand` is shown below: +

.Clear Class Activity Diagram
image::ClearActivityDiagram.svg[]

After user enter the `clear` command, the `ClearCommandParser` will check if the arguments are empty: +

** if `Yes`, a new `ClearCommand` object will be created with no flag
** If `No`, a new `ClearCommand` object will be created with the flags. +

Afterward,  the new `ClearCommand` object will be executed.

During the execution of the `ClearCommand`:

** If `-f` flag is found in flags, the respective order book list will be cleared and
display a success message to the user.
** If there are no `-f` flag found in flags, a pop up will appeared with the confirmation message.
   User would be required to press either one of the following two buttons:
*** `Yes` button - The respective order book list will be cleared and display successful clear message to the user.
*** `No` button - Pop up closed and end of activity.

[[clear-structure]]
==== Structure of Clear Command
The following diagramS shows the overview of the `ClearCommand` Class Diagram: +

.Clear Command Parser Class Diagram
image::ClearCommandParserClassDiagram.svg[]

.Clear Command Class Diagram
image::ClearCommandClassDiagram.svg[]

In the `ClearCommand` class, there are also some static messages for the different input command
the user has key in:

1. `MESSAGE_USAGE` +
clear: Clear either both order book list and return order book list or one of them. +
Parameters: -o/-r/-f +
Example: clear -o -f +

2. `MESSAGE_SUCCESS_ORDER_BOOK` +
Inform the user that order book list has been cleared successfully.

3. `MESSAGE_SUCCESS_RETURN_BOOK` +
Inform the user that return order book list has been cleared successfully.

4. `MESSAGE_SUCCESS_BOTH_BOOK` +
Inform the user that both order book lists have been cleared successfully.

5. `MESSAGE_ENQUIRY_ORDER_BOOK` +
Confirmation message to the user if the user want to clear order book list.

6. `MESSAGE_ENQUIRY_RETURN_BOOK` +
Confirmation message to the user if the user want to clear return order book list.

7. `MESSAGE_ENQUIRY_BOTH_BOOK` +
Confirmation message to the user if the user want to clear both order book lists.

[[clear-interaction]]
==== Interactions between objects when Clear Command is executed
In this section, the interactions between objects when `ClearCommand` is executed will be display in the Clear Command
Sequence Diagram below: +

.Clear Command Sequence Diagram
image::ClearCommandSequenceDiagram.svg[]

The arguments passed to the Clear Command will be parsed by the `ClearCommandParser` class +
If the given arguments are valid, a new `Clear` Command object will be returned.

In the `ClearCommandParser`, there will be two validation checks: +
1. `isValidFlag(flag)`: Check whether the flag is one of the three flags: `-f`, `-o` and `-r` +
2. `isInvalidFlagFormat(flag, flags)`: Ensure the arguments do not have both `-o` and `-r` flags.

After the two validation checks, the flag will be added into HashSet, *flags* which will then passed to
the new `ClearCommand` object created by `ClearCommandParser` and it is being returned to the `LogicManager`.
The `LogicManager` will start to run the execute the `clear` Command, which will be
shown in details in below diagram:

.Execution of Clear Command Sequence Diagram
image::ClearCommandSequenceDiagram2.svg[]

After `LogicManager` call the `ClearCommand#execute(model)`, the `clear` Command will update the model by creating a
new `OrderBook` object and pass it to `Model#setOrerBook(orderBook)`, whereby the `Model` will then update its own
orderBook. In addition, the `clear` Command will pass back a new `CommandResult` object with the success message
in it back to the `LogicManager`.

After executing any of the sequences above, a new `CommandResult` object will be return back to `LogicManager`.

//end::clear[]

[[delete]]
=== Delete Feature
In this section, you will learn more about how the `delete` feature is implemented.

==== What is the Delete Feature
The delete feature allows the user to delete orders in either the order list or return order list. +

The delete feature was implemented as a `DeleteCommand` in the `Logic` package. +

The `delete` command has the following format: +

* `delete` `FLAG` `INDEX`

[NOTE]
====
1. A `FLAG` is a compulsory argument that indicates the list to delete from. +
It can be either `-o` or `-r`. +
A `-o` `FLAG` argument indicates deletion from the order list. +
A `-r` `FLAG` argument indicates deletion from the return order list. +

2. An `INDEX` is a compulsory argument that identifies the specific order to
delete in the list. +
The `INDEX` *must be a positive integer* i.e. 1, 2, 3, ...
====

==== Execution paths of Delete command
In this section, you will learn more about the execution paths for the `delete` command.

.Delete Command Activity Diagram
image::DeleteActivityDiagram.svg[]

There are four possible execution paths for the `delete` command

1. User provides an invalid `delete` command input +
This results in a parse exception +

2. User provides a valid `delete` command input that has a flag indicating deletion
from the order list. +
The specified order will be deleted from the order list. +

3. User provides a valid `delete` command input that has a flag indicating deletion
from the return order list. +
The specified return order will be deleted from the return order list. +

4. User provides an invalid `delete` command input that has an invalid flag. +
A Command Exception wil be generated.


==== Structure of Delete command
In this section, you will learn more about the relationships between objects
related to the `delete` command.

.Delete Command Class Diagram
image::DeleteClassDiagram.svg[]

In the `DeleteCommand` class, there are also static strings present that represent the
various possible messages. +
For some of the message strings, there are placeholder %s strings used for including dynamic input +
These messages are the following:

1. `MESSAGE_DELETE_ORDER_SUCCESS` +
Deleted Order: %1$s +

2. `MESSAGE_INVALID_FLAG` +
Invalid flag given! +

==== Interactions between Delete command and its associated objects
In this section, you will learn more about the `delete` command and its inner workings.

The sequence diagram below shows the interactions for a `delete` command execution of
`delete` `-o` `1`. +
This indicates that the first order should be deleted from the order
list.

.Delete Command Sequence Diagram for `delete` `-o` `1`
image::DeleteSequenceDiagram.svg[]

The arguments passed to the `delete` command will be parsed by the `DeleteCommandParser` class. +
If the given arguments are valid, a new `DeleteCommand` object will be returned. +
In this class, invalid arguments will result in a `ParseException`. +
Two checks will be done for the arguments:

1. Invalid `FLAG` argument

2. Invalid `INDEX` argument

When the `LogicManager` runs the `execute()` method of `DeleteCommand`,
`DeleteCommand` will first check the list to delete from. +

The `deleteFromOrderList(model)` method of `DeleteCommand` will then
be called and the filtered order list will be obtained from the `getFilteredOrderList()`
method of the `model`. +

The specified order at `INDEX` 1 will be deleted using the `deleteOrder(order)` method
in the `model`.

A new `CommandResult` will be created and returned to the `LogicManager`.


The sequence diagram below shows the interactions for a `delete` command execution of
`delete` `-r` `2`. +
This indicates that the second order should be deleted from the return order
list.

.Delete Command Sequence Diagram for `delete` `-r` `2`
image::DeleteSequenceDiagram2.svg[]

The arguments passed to the `delete` command will be parsed by the `DeleteCommandParser` class. +
If the given arguments are valid, a new `DeleteCommand` object will be returned. +
In this class, invalid arguments will result in a `ParseException`. +
Two checks will be done for the arguments:

1. Invalid `FLAG` argument

2. Invalid `INDEX` argument

When the `LogicManager` runs the `execute()` method of `DeleteCommand`,
`DeleteCommand` will first check the list to delete from. +

The `deleteFromReturnList(model)` method of `DeleteCommand` will then
be called and the filtered return order list will be obtained from the `getFilteredReturnOrderList()`
method of the `model`. +

The specified return order at `INDEX` 2 will be deleted using the `deleteReturnOrder(returnOrder)` method
in the `model`.

A new `CommandResult` will be created and returned to the `LogicManager`.


[[delivered]]
=== Delivered Feature
In this section, the <<what-is-delivered, functionality>> of the `delivered` feature, the
<<execution-paths-delivered, expected execution path>>,
the <<structure-delivered, structure>> of the `DeliveredCommand` class and the <<sequence-delivered, interactions>>
between objects with the `DeliveredCommand` will be discussed.


[[what-is-delivered]]
==== What is the Delivered feature
The `delivered` function allows the user to mark orders or return orders
as delivered after delivering an order or a return order. +

The `delivered` feature was implemented as the `DeliveredCommand` in the `logic` package. +
The `delivered` function requires a valid <<command_prefix, `FLAG`>> and a valid <<command_prefix, `INDEX`>>. +
i.e. `delivered` <<command_prefix, `INDEX`>> <<command_prefix, `FLAG`>>

The <<command_prefix, `FLAG`>> can either be '-o' or '-r', which indicates which list
(order list or return order list respectively) to mark the parcel from. The <<command_prefix, `FLAG`>> is
only valid when either '-o' and '-r' is used. All other inputs will be regarded as invalid. +

The <<command_prefix, `INDEX`>> is a positive integer that determines
which order or return order to be marked as delivered. The <<command_prefix, `INDEX`>> is only valid if
it is a positive integer and if it is not bigger than the size of the order list or return order list, depending
on the <<command_prefix, `FLAG`>>that is provided. For instance, if the '-o' <<command_prefix, `FLAG`>> is provided,
the <<command_prefix, `INDEX`>> should not be greater than the size of the order list. +

[[execution-paths-delivered]]
==== Execution Paths of Delivered Command
.Activity Diagram of the Delivered Command
image::DeliveredCommandActivityDiagram.png[]
The above activity diagram shows the logic behind the `DeliveredCommand` which is determined in
the `DeliveredCommandParser` class when the user inputs the command word `delivered` to activate the
`delivered` feature.

[[structure-delivered]]
==== Structure of Delivered Command
image::DeliveredClassDiagram.png[]
The above class diagram shows the structure of the `DeliveredCommand` and
its associated classes and interfaces. Some methods and fields are not included because they are
not extensively utilised in `DeliveredCommand`; such as public static fields and getter/setter methods.

==== Sequence Diagram for delivering an order
The sequence diagrams for the *Delivered Command* are shown below.

.Delivered Command Sequence Diagram
image::DeliveredSequenceDiagram.png[]

.Execution of Delivered Command
image::DeliveredSequenceDiagram2.png[]
The arguments typed into Delino by the user will first be done by the `execute`
method in `LogicManager`. After which, an `OrderBookParser` object will be created to parse
the input which is determined by the command word via the parseCommand method. In this case, it is the
`delivered` command word that will be parsed. +

Then, a `DeliveredCommandParser` object will be created to parse the arguments after removing
the command word `delivered` from the user's input. Based on the command word `delivered`,
a `DeliveredCommand` object will be created. +

Subsequently, the parseCommand method in `LogicManager` will continue to create a CommandResult
based on the validity of the user's input; which is determined by the `execute` method in
`DeliveredCommand`. +

The `execute` method of `DeliveredCommand` will first check if a valid
<<command_prefix, `FLAG`>> is present in the user's input. If the <<command_prefix, `FLAG`>>
is not valid, a `CommandException` will be thrown to the user to tell him/her that their
input was invalid and tell them the format which their input should follow. +

If a valid <<command_prefix, `FLAG`>> is present, this will trigger the
`processDeliveryOfOrder` method in `DeliveredCommand` which will check if
a valid <<command_prefix, `INDEX`>> is present in the user's input. +

If the <<command_prefix, `INDEX`>> is not valid, `processDeliveryOfOrder` method will throw
a `CommandException` to the user; telling him/her that their input was invalid and the format
that their input should follow. i.e. `delivered` <<command_prefix, `FLAG`>>
 <<command_prefix, `INDEX`>> +

If both <<command_prefix, `FLAG`>> and <<command_prefix, `INDEX`>> are valid, an `Order`
or `ReturnOrder` object will be created based on the <<command_prefix, `FLAG`>>.
The <<command_prefix, `INDEX`>> will determine which order or return order to take from
the order list or return order list respectively using the appropriate getter method.
The `Order` or `ReturnOrder` object will be checked to see if it was delivered using the `isDelivered()` method. +

If the `Order` or `ReturnOrder` was already delivered, this will call the `updateOrderList(model)` or
`updatedReturnOrderList(model)` method respectively in `DeliveredCommand` and a new
instance of `CommandResult` will be created to tell the user that the order or return order was delivered. +

If the `Order` or `ReturnOrder` was not delivered, this will call the `deliverAndUpdateOrderList(model)` or
`deliverAndUpdateReturnOrderList(model)` respectively in `DeliveredCommand`. In these methods, the particular `Order` or
`ReturnOrder` will be retrieved from the `model` using the `getFilteredOrderList()` or `getFilteredReturnOrderList()`
method. Based on the retrieved `Order` or `ReturnOrder`, a new `Order` or `ReturnOrder` with the `delivered`
delivery status will be instantiated using the `createDeliveredOrder` or `createDeliveredReturnOrder` methods respectively. +

Then, the `setOrder` or `setReturnOrder` method will be called to replace the original `Order` or `ReturnOrder` object
respectively in `model`. The `deliverOrder` or `deliverReturnOrder` method will be called to to set the
delivery status of the object to delivered. Then, the `updateFilteredOrderList()` method or `updateFilteredReturnOrderList()`
method to update the list in the `model`. +

Based on the new updates, a new `CommandResult` object will be instantiated to print the message success to the user.


[[edit]]
=== Edit Feature

In this section, the <<what-is-edit,functionality>> of the `edit` feature, the expected <<edit-path-execution, execution path>>, the <<edit-structure, structure>> of the `EditCommand` class
and the <<edit-interactions, interactions>> between objects with the `EditCommand` object will be discussed.

[[what-is-edit]]
==== What is Edit Command

The `edit` feature was implemented as `EditCommand` in the `Logic` package. +

`edit` feature format : `edit` `INDEX` `<<command_flags, FLAG>>` `<<command_prefix, ORDER_ATTRIBUTE_PREFIX>>`/`NEW_VALUE` `[<<command_prefix, ORDER_ATTRIBUTE_PREFIX>>`/`NEW_VALUE]`

The `edit` feature allows the user to edit any field except delivery status of the order or the return order. However, user must provide a `<<command_flags, FLAG>>` and `INDEX`. +
`<<command_flags, FLAG>>` to indicate which parcel type to edit; `-o` and  `-r` `<<command_flags, FLAG>>` to represent Order or Return Order respectively. +
`INDEX` to indicate which parcel the user wants to edit. +
The list of the different parcel fields are listed in Appendix E: <<command_prefix, Glossary>>. +

[NOTE]
This feature allows user to edit more than one field within a command.

[IMPORTANT]
====
**Limitation **

* Editing the delivery/return time is that the updated delivery date or return date must not be in the past.
* There must be an order first for `edit` command to work.
====

[[edit-path-execution]]
==== Execution paths of Edit Command

.EditCommand Activity Diagram
image::EditCommandActivityDiagram.svg[]

The above figure illustrates the execution path of `edit` command when performed by the user. +

Input when received, will be parsed by the `OrderBookParser`. `OrderBookParser` will check if command word matches any features command word. +
In this feature, the command word is `edit`. If no command word is detected, a exception class should be generated for displaying of error message. `CommandException` is used in this feature to achieve that function. +

Once validated, user input is once again parse and check for validity. At this step, if user have provided input not matching the valid `edit` <<what-is-edit, format>>, an exception class is thrown. +
Furthermore, if `NEW_VALUE` is invalid an exception should be thrown as well. +
`ParseException` class is used in this scenario.

Some invalid `NEW_VALUE`: +
1) Editing delivery date or return date to the past. +
2) Change the transaction id of one parcel to match another parcel. +
3) Violation of any field(s) restriction. +

A correct input will prompts Delino to carry out the rest of the steps according. +
1) Checking of the `<<command_flags, FLAG>>` +
2) Edits the the parcel.
3) Display edit success message.

[[edit-structure]]
==== Structure of Edit Command

.Edit Command Class Diagram
image::EditCommandClassDiagram.png[]
The class diagram above depicts the structure of `EditCommand`. As per any `Command` class, `EditCommand` needs to extend the abstract class `Command`. +
Information that are left out in this class diagram are the common messages used in `EditCommand`.

[[edit-interactions]]
==== Interactions between Edit Command and it's associated objects

.Edit Command Sequence Diagram
image::EditCommandSequenceDiagram.svg[]

The above figure illustrates the important interactions of `EditCommand` when the user successfully edit the first displayed order name to `Alice`. +

The handling of breaking down the user input is done in the `EditcommandParser` class which is called upon by the `OrderBookParser` after an initial check for correctness of the command input. +

The `EditParcelDescriptor` class is a static class contained in the `EditCommand` class. It act as a helper class to allow the setting of all the `NEW_VALUE` to the corresponding `<<command_prefix, ORDER_ATTRIBUTE_PREFIX>>` in the `EditCommandParser` class.
The `EditParcelDescriptor` object is then passed back as a parameter to instantiate an `EditCommand`. In the diagram above, the `EditParcelDescriptor` object is named as `epd`.
The `EditCommand` object is then passed back as `e` to the `LogicManager` which will then call the `EditCommand#execute`. This execute method mainly calls the 3 helper method, not shown, `EditCommand#createEditedOrder`/`EditComand#createEditedReturnOrder` and `EditCommand#generalSetParcel`.
The main function of these methods are to help `EditCommand` in updating the `ObservableList` in the `Model` class which is responsible for the updating of list displayed.

The `ObeservableList` is a JavaFX function which listens and automatically changes the list once an update is performed.

[[return]]
=== Return Feature
In this section, you will learn more about how the `return` feature is implemented.

[[what-is-return]]
==== What is the Return Feature
The return feature allows the user to either: +
1. Create a new return order from his/her input parcel attributes. +
2. Convert an existing delivered order to a return order.

The return feature was implemented as a `ReturnCommand` in the `Logic` package. +

The `return` command has two possible formats: +

1. `return` <<command_prefix, `TRANSACTION_ID`>>
If the user provides only a valid <<command_prefix, `TRANSACTION_ID`>> in his input, the order with the given
<<command_prefix, `TRANSACTION_ID`>> will be converted into a return order with the same attributes.
The created return order will be added into the return order list.

2. `return` <<command_prefix, `TRANSACTION_ID`>> <<command_prefix, `NAME`>> <<command_prefix, `ADDRESS`>> <<command_prefix, `PHONE_NUMBER`>>
<<command_prefix, `EMAIL`>> <<command_prefix, `RETURN_TIMESTAMP`>> <<command_prefix, `WAREHOUSE_LOCATION`>> <<command_prefix, `[COMMENTS]`>>
<<command_prefix, `[ITEM_TYPE]`>>
If the user provides these compulsory parcel attributes, a return order with the given parcel attributes will be created and added to the return order list.

[NOTE]
====
1. All return orders do not have the <<command_prefix, `CASH_ON_DELIVERY`>> parcel attribute.
2. The <<command_prefix, `TRANSACTION_ID`>> is alphanumeric, which determines the <<command_prefix, `TRANSACTION_ID`>> of the resulting return order.
3. The <<command_prefix, `NAME`>> consists of alphabets and determines the <<command_prefix, `NAME`>> of the resulting return order.
4. The <<command_prefix, `ADDRESS`>> is alphanumeric and determines the <<command_prefix, `ADDRESS`>>  of the resulting return order.
5. The <<command_prefix, `PHONE_NUMBER`>> consists of only numbers and determines the <<command_prefix, `PHONE_NUMBER`>> of the resulting return order.
6. The <<command_prefix, `EMAIL`>> is alphanumeric and determines the <<command_prefix, `EMAIL`>> of the resulting return order.
7. The <<command_prefix, `RETURN_TIMESTAMP`>> should include the date in YYYY-MM-DD format and time in 24-hour format with a whitespace in between
the date and time.
8. The <<command_prefix, `WAREHOUSE_LOCATION`>> is alphanumeric and it determines the <<command_prefix, `WAREHOUSE_LOCATION`>> of the resulting return order.
9. The <<command_prefix, `[COMMENTS]`>> is an optional alphanumeric field and determines the <<command_prefix, `[COMMENTS]`>> of the resulting return order.
10. The <<command_prefix, `[ITEM_TYPE]`>> is an optional alphanumeric field and determines the <<command_prefix, `[ITEM_TYPE]`>> of the resulting return order.

[[execution-paths-return]]
==== Execution paths of Return command
In this section, you will learn more about the execution paths for the `return` command.

.Return Command Activity Diagram
image::ReturnCommandActivityDiagram.svg[]

There are three possible execution paths for the `return` command

1. User provides an invalid `return` command input +
This will result in a parse exception and an error message will be displayed to the user.
2. User provides a valid `return` command input with a valid <<command_prefix, `TRANSACTION_ID`>>, i.e. +
`return` <<command_prefix, `TRANSACTION_ID`>> +
If the order with the given <<command_prefix, `TRANSACTION_ID`>> is delivered,
it will be converted to an existing order with the given <<command_prefix, `TRANSACTION_ID`>> into a return order. +
This return order will then be added into the return order list.
3. User provides a valid `return` command input with all compulsory parcel attributes, i.e. +
`return` <<command_prefix, `TRANSACTION_ID`>> <<command_prefix, `NAME`>> <<command_prefix, `ADDRESS`>> <<command_prefix, `PHONE_NUMBER`>>
<<command_prefix, `EMAIL`>> <<command_prefix, `RETURN_TIMESTAMP`>> <<command_prefix, `WAREHOUSE_LOCATION`>> <<command_prefix, `[COMMENTS]`>>
<<command_prefix, `[ITEM_TYPE]`>> +
If the given <<command_prefix, `TRANSACTION_ID`>> does not exist as an order or return order,
this will create a new return order based on the given parcel attributes and the resulting return order
will be added to the return order list. +
If the given `return` <<command_prefix, `TRANSACTION_ID`>> already exists as an order or return order, an error message
will be displayed to the user that an order or return order already exists in the order list or return order list respectively.
4. User provides a valid `return` command input with an invalid <<command_prefix, `TRANSACTION_ID`>> +
This will result in a parse exception and an error message will be displayed to the user.
5. User provides a valid `return` command but one or more of the compulsory parcel attributes is/are invalid.
This will result in a parse exception and an error message will be displayed to the user.

[[structure-return]]
==== Structure of Return Command
image::ReturnClassDiagram.png[]
The above class diagram shows the structure of the `ReturnCommand`
and its associated classes and interfaces. Some methods and fields are not included because they are
not extensively utilised in `ReturnCommand`; such as public static fields and getter/setter methods.

The above class diagram shows the structure of the `DeliveredCommand` and
its associated classes and interfaces. Some methods and fields are not included because they are
not extensively utilised in `DeliveredCommand`; such as public static fields and getter/setter methods.

==== Sequence Diagram for converting an order into a return order
The sequence diagrams for the *Return Command* are shown below.

.Return Command Sequence Diagram
image::DeliveredSequenceDiagram.png[]

.Execution of Delivered Command
image::ReturnCommandSequenceDiagram2.png[]
The arguments typed into Delino by the user will first be done by the `execute`
method in `LogicManager`. After which, an `OrderBookParser` object will be created to parse
the input which is determined by the command word via the parseCommand method. In this case, it is the
`delivered` command word that will be parsed. +

Then, a `DeliveredCommandParser` object will be created to parse the arguments after removing
the command word `delivered` from the user's input. Based on the command word `delivered`,
a `DeliveredCommand` object will be created. +

Subsequently, the parseCommand method in `LogicManager` will continue to create a CommandResult
based on the validity of the user's input; which is determined by the `execute` method in
`DeliveredCommand`. +

The `execute` method of `DeliveredCommand` will first check if a valid
<<command_prefix, `FLAG`>> is present in the user's input. If the <<command_prefix, `FLAG`>>
is not valid, a `CommandException` will be thrown to the user to tell him/her that their
input was invalid and tell them the format which their input should follow. +

If a valid <<command_prefix, `FLAG`>> is present, this will trigger the
`processDeliveryOfOrder` method in `DeliveredCommand` which will check if
a valid <<command_prefix, `INDEX`>> is present in the user's input. +

If the <<command_prefix, `INDEX`>> is not valid, `processDeliveryOfOrder` method will throw
a `CommandException` to the user; telling him/her that their input was invalid and the format
that their input should follow. i.e. `delivered` <<command_prefix, `FLAG`>>
 <<command_prefix, `INDEX`>> +

If both <<command_prefix, `FLAG`>> and <<command_prefix, `INDEX`>> are valid, an `Order`
or `ReturnOrder` object will be created based on the <<command_prefix, `FLAG`>>.
The <<command_prefix, `INDEX`>> will determine which order or return order to take from
the order list or return order list respectively using the appropriate getter method.
The `Order` or `ReturnOrder` object will be checked to see if it was delivered using the `isDelivered()` method. +

If the `Order` or `ReturnOrder` was already delivered, this will call the `updateOrderList(model)` or
`updatedReturnOrderList(model)` method respectively in `DeliveredCommand` and a new
instance of `CommandResult` will be created to tell the user that the order or return order was delivered. +

If the `Order` or `ReturnOrder` was not delivered, this will call the `deliverAndUpdateOrderList(model)` or
`deliverAndUpdateReturnOrderList(model)` respectively in `DeliveredCommand`. In these methods, the particular `Order` or
`ReturnOrder` will be retrieved from the `model` using the `getFilteredOrderList()` or `getFilteredReturnOrderList()`
method. Based on the retrieved `Order` or `ReturnOrder`, a new `Order` or `ReturnOrder` with the `delivered`
delivery status will be instantiated using the `createDeliveredOrder` or `createDeliveredReturnOrder` methods respectively. +

Then, the `setOrder` or `setReturnOrder` method will be called to replace the original `Order` or `ReturnOrder` object
respectively in `model`. The `deliverOrder` or `deliverReturnOrder` method will be called to to set the
delivery status of the object to delivered. Then, the `updateFilteredOrderList()` method or `updateFilteredReturnOrderList()`
method to update the list in the `model`. +

Based on the new updates, a new `CommandResult` object will be instantiated to print the message success to the user.


[[nearby]]
=== Nearby Feature
In this section, you will learn more about how the `nearby` feature is implemented.

==== What is the Nearby Feature
The nearby feature allows the user to view all orders that are located at a particular area
based on a given search criteria. +

The nearby feature was implemented as a `NearbyCommand` in the `Logic` package. +

The `nearby` command has two possible formats: +

1. `nearby` `FLAG` `POSTAL_SECTOR`
2. `nearby` `FLAG` `AREA`

[NOTE]
====
1. `FLAG` is an optional argument and indicates which order list to search on. +
It can be either `-o` or `-r`.
A `-o` `FLAG` argument indicates that the order list will be searched. +
A `-r` `FLAG` argument indicates that the return order list will be searched. +
By default, if no `FLAG` arguments are provided, both order list and return order list will be searched.

2. Searching of nearby orders is done by either `POSTAL_SECTOR` or `AREA` +

* A `POSTAL_SECTOR` refers to the first *two* digits of a six digit Singapore postal code. +
The list of postal sectors and their corresponding general locations can be found
https://www.ura.gov.sg/realEstateIIWeb/resources/misc/list_of_postal_districts.htm[on this website]. +

* An `AREA` refers to one of the five areas of Singapore:
** Central
** East
** North East
** West
** North
** You can obtain more detailed information about each area from
https://keylocation.sg/singapore/districts-map[this website]
====


==== Execution paths of Nearby command
In this section, you will learn more about the execution paths for the `nearby` command.

.Nearby Command Activity Diagram
image::NearbyActivityDiagram.svg[]

There are four possible execution paths for the `nearby` command

1. User provides an invalid `nearby` command input +
This results in a parse exception +
2. User provides a valid `nearby` command input that has no flags +
All matching nearby orders will be shown for all lists (order list and return order list) +
3. User provides a valid `nearby` command input that has one flag. This flag indicates the order list (`-o`) +
All matching nearby orders will be shown for the order list.
4. User provides a valid `nearby` command input that has one flag. This flag indicates the return order list (`-r`) +
All matching nearby orders will be shown for the return order list.

The matching orders are determined based on the given user argument. +
If a two digit integer is given, searching of nearby orders will be based on their postal sector. +
Else, searching of nearby orders will be based on their area. +
There are currently five areas that are searchable:

1. Central
2. East
3. North-East
4. West
5. North

==== Structure of Nearby command
In this section, you will learn more about the relationships between objects
related to the `nearby` command.

.Nearby Command Class Diagram
image::NearbyClassDiagram.svg[]

In the `NearbyCommand` class, there are also static strings present that represent the
various possible messages. +
For some of the message strings, there are placeholder %s strings used for including dynamic input +
These messages are the following:

1. `MESSAGE_USAGE` +
nearby: View all orders located at the same postal sector based on the displayed list. +
Parameters: [FLAG] POSTAL_SECTOR or AREA +
An optional flag may be given to indicate the list to be searched for. +
The flag can be either -o for orders for -r for return orders +
A postal sector is the first two digits of a six digit Singapore postal code +
An area is one of the following: Central, East, North-East, West, North +
Example: nearby -o 14 +
Example: nearby -r central +
Example: nearby east +
2. `MESSAGE_SUCCESS_POSTAL_SECTOR` +
Displayed all orders in postal sector. +
General Location: %1$s +
3. `MESSAGE_SUCCESS_AREA` +
Displayed all orders in area (%s) +
4. `MESSAGE_FAILURE_POSTAL_SECTOR` +
Invalid postal sector given. +
5. `MESSAGE_FAILURE_AREA` +
Invalid area given. +


==== Interactions between Nearby command and its associated objects
In this section, you will learn more about the `nearby` command and its inner workings.

The sequence diagram below shows the interactions for a `nearby` command execution of
`nearby` `-o` `14`. +
This indicates that the order list should be operated on and
all orders in the order list that have a `POSTAL_SECTOR` of `14`
should be displayed to the user.


.Nearby Command Sequence Diagram for `nearby` `-o` `14`
image::NearbyCommandSequenceDiagram1.svg[]

The arguments passed to the Nearby Command will be parsed by the `NearbyCommandParser` class. +
If the given arguments are valid, a new `NearbyCommand` object will be returned. +
In this class, invalid arguments will result in a `ParseException`. +
Two types of invalid arguments are checked for: empty arguments
and arguments with only whitespace characters.

The `execute()` function of the `NearbyCommand` will first check if the given arguments
are in the format required for postal sector search (the argument can be converted into an integer).
If the first check is successful, the argument will be converted into an integer and
a second check is performed via the `isValidPostalSector(Index postalSector)` function
of the `NearbyCommandUtil` helper class.

[NOTE]
====
`NearbyCommandUtil` is a helper class that contains functions and variables used for
identifying postal sectors and their corresponding general locations. +
This class was created to reduce the responsibility of the `NearbyCommand` class. +

* A `HashMap` was used to store information about postal sectors and their respective general locations.
====

The `model` will then be updated by the `updateFilteredOrderList(orderPredicate)` function. +

A `CommandResult` is then generated and returned to the `LogicManager`.


The sequence diagram below shows the interactions for a `nearby` command execution of
`nearby` `-o` `central`. +
This indicates that the order list should be operated on and
all orders in the order list that have an `AREA` of `central`
should be displayed to the user.

.Nearby Command Sequence Diagram of `nearby` `-o` `central`
image::NearbyCommandSequenceDiagram2.svg[]

The `NearbyCommandParser` will check for invalid arguments given by the user. +
Invalid arguments can be either empty arguments or arguments with
only whitespace characters.
A `ParseException` will be generated if an invalid argument is present.

A new `NearbyCommand` will be created and returned to `LogicManager`.

`LogicManager` will then call the `execute()` function of the `NearbyCommand`. +
There will then be a check for whether the given argument is a valid area with the
function `isValidArea(area)` present in the `DistrictInfo` class.

[NOTE]
====
`DistrictInfo` is a helper class that contains functions and variables used for
identifying areas. +
This class was created to reduce the responsibility of the `NearbyCommand` class. +
====

The model will then be updated using the `updateFilteredOrderList(orderPredicate)` function.

A new `CommandResult` will be created and returned to the `LogicManager`.


The sequence diagram below shows the interactions for a `nearby` command execution of
`nearby`. +
This will result in a `ParseException` as invalid arguments are provided.

.Nearby Command Sequence Diagram of `nearby`
image::NearbySequenceDiagramParseException.svg[]

The exception will be thrown in the `NearbyCommandParser`.

//tag::import[]
[[import]]
=== Import feature
In this section, the <<what-is-import, functionality>> of the `import` feature, the expected <<import-execution-path, execution path>>, the <<import-structure, structure>> of the
`ImportCommand` class and the <<import-interaction, interactions>> between objects with the `ImportCommand` object will be discussed.

[[what-is-import]]
==== What is the Import feature
The `import` feature was implemented as the `ImportCommand` in the `logic` package. +
The `import` feature allows users to save the trouble of adding the delivery orders and the return orders one by one
when they have large amount of delivery orders or return orders to add into Delino.

[[import-execution-path]]
==== Execution paths of Import Command
The execution path of the `ImportCommand` is shown below: +

.Import Command Activity Diagram
image::ImportActivityDiagram.svg[]

After the user enter the `import` command, there are three validation check for the file based on the input argument, `FILE_NAME`: +

* Check if the input argument has the .csv file extension at the back:
** If `Yes`, continue with the next validation check.
** If `No`, display error message to the user.

* Check if the filePath is valid: +

** If `Yes`, continue with the next validation check.
** If `No`, display error message to the user.

* Check if the file able to read: +

** If `Yes`, retrieve the data from the CSV file and process the data.
** If `No`, display the error message to the user.

Afterward, a new `ImportCommand` will be created and executed. For every data inside the list, either order or return order
will be added into the order book list and return order book list respectively based on the `orderType` value.
If the `orderType` is invalid, add the data into the result, which will be displayed to the user after processing.

[[import-structure]]
==== Structure of Import Command
The following diagram shows the overview structure of the `ImportCommand` Class Diagram: +

.Import Command Class Diagram
image::ImportClassDiagram.svg[]

In the `ImportCommand` Class, there are also a few static message to display to the user for the various scenarios occurred
during the importing of data from the CSV file: +

1.  `MESSAGE_USAGE` +
import: Import the data in .csv file into Delino +
Parameters: fileName.csv\n  +
Example: import orders.csv +

2. `INVALID_MESSAGE` +
Invalid order type encountered.

3. `DUPLICATE_ORDER_MESSAGE` +
Duplicate order encountered.

4. `DUPLICATE_RETURN_MESSAGE` +
Duplicate return order encountered.

5. `MESSAGE_INVALID_CSV_FILEPATH` +
The csv file is not found in the data folder.

6. `PROCESS_FAILED_MESSAGE` +
Failed to process the data. +
This could be due to invalid order type encountered or invalid data input for the attributes in
order and return order.

[[import-interaction]]
==== Interactions between objects when Import Command is executed
In this section, the interactions between the objects when `ImportCommand` is executed will be shown in the Import Command
Sequence Diagram below: +

.Import Command Sequence Diagram
image::ImportCommandSequenceDiagram.svg[]

The arguments passed to the `import` Command will be parsed by the `ImportCommandParser` class. +
If the given arguments are valid, a new `ImportCommand` object will be returned.
In this class, invalid arguments will result in a `ParseException`. +

Three types of checks will be done before returning the `ImportCommand`:

1. Check whether the argument has the `.csv` file extension at the back.
2. Check whether the file is exists in the data folder.
3. Check whether the first prefix is `orderType` prefix.

[NOTE]
====
`CsvProcessor` is  a helper class that helps to retrieve the data from the csv file and process the data before
giving to `ImportCommand`.
====

After the `ImportCommand` object is being returned to the `LogicManager`, the `LogicManager` will start
to run the execute the `ImportCommand`, this will be shown at the diagram below.

.Execution of Import Command Sequence Diagram
image::ImportCommandSequenceDiagram2.svg[]

The `ImportCommand#execute(model)` will first check if the data given starts with
*order* or *return* and pass to the `InsertCommandParser` or `ReturnCommandParser` respectively. +

Afterwards, `InsertCommandParser` or `ReturnCommandParser` will return the `InsertCommand` or `ReturnCommand` respectively
if it successfully parse the data. The `ImportCommand` will then call the `InsertCommand#execute(Model)`
or `ReturnCommand#execute(Model)` depend whether it is delivery order or return order. This will cause a delivery order or return order being added into the `Model`.

The `ImportCommand` will call its own `printResult()` function and return a String message to the `CommandResult` object
which is then pass back to the `LogicManager`.
//end::import[]

[[search]]
=== Search Feature

In this section, the <<what-is-search,functionality>> of the `search` feature, the expected <<search-path-execution, execution path>>, the <<search-structure, structure>> of the `SearchCommand` class
and the <<search-interactions, interactions>> between objects with the `SearchCommand` object will be discussed.

[[what-is-search]]
==== What is the Search feature

The `search` feature was implemented as the `SearchCommand` in the `logic` package.

The search function allow users to search for any orders according to the provided input. +

`search` feature format: `search` `<<command_flags, [FLAG]>>` `<<command_prefix, [ORDER_ATTRIBUTE_PREFIX]>>`/`[KEYWORD]`

[IMPORTANT]
A space is needed in between each word.

[NOTE]
Keyword search is case-insensitive. E.g: Given `Jeremy` it matches `JeReMy`, `jeremy` or any permutations of alphabet casing.

There are two mode of searching, *general search* or *specific search*. +
If the user does not provide any `<<command_prefix, ORDER_ATTRIBUTE_PREFIX>>`, a *general search* mode will be performed on orders, return orders, or both depending on the `<<command_flag, FLAG>>`. +

The `<<command_flags, [FLAG]>>` `-o` when given, searches only for parcels in the order list. +
The `<<command_flags, [FLAG]>>` `-r` when given, searches only for the parcels in the return list.

* *General search* will search for all fields in an order/return orders/both that have any matching fields. +

If the user provide any `<<command_prefix, ORDER_ATTRIBUTE_PREFIX>>`, a *specific search* will be performed. +

* *Specific search* will search orders/return orders/both based on the given `<<command_prefix, ORDER_ATTRIBUTE_PREFIX>>`.

[[search-path-execution]]
==== Execution paths of Search Command

.Search Command Activity Diagram
image::SearchCommandActivityDiagram.svg[]

The above activity diagram illustrates the different execution paths of `search` command. +
Whenever a user keys in an input with the `search` keyword, the `SearchCommandParser` class will handle the parsing of input. +
User input will be validated in the `SearchCommandParser` class.

Input is deemed as invalid and `ParseException` is thrown under these scenarios: +
1) `<<command_flags, FLAG>>` given is not `-o` or `-r`. +
2) Multiple `<<command_flags, FLAG>>` detected. +
3) No `KEYWORD` is given after `search`.

View the list of allowed prefixes in this `search` command <<command_prefix, here>>.

[[search-structure]]
==== Structure of Search Command
.Search Command Class Diagram
image::SearchCommandClassDiagram.png[]

The above class diagram depicts the structure of the class `SearchCommand`. As per any `Command` class, `SearchCommand` needs to extend the abstract class `Command`. +
Information that are left out in this class diagram are the common messages used in `SearchCommand`.

[[search-interactions]]
==== Interactions between objects when Search Command is executed

.Search Command Sequence Diagram
image::SearchCommandSequenceDiagram.svg[]

The sequence diagram above illustrates the interactions between objects when `search` command is performed by the user. +
Particularly, the interactions shown is a success `search` command executed by the user and only an abstract view is shown.


`LogicManager` first calls `parseCommand` with arguments representing the user input, `Alice`. The `SearchCommandParser` will then check for any invalid arguments passed by the user. +

[TIP]
====
* If the given arguments are valid, `SearchCommandParser` will return  a new `SearchCommand` object. +
* If the given arguments are invalid or empty, a `ParseException` object will be thrown (not shown in the diagram).
====

The `SearchCommandParser` will then checks for the presence of any `<<command_flags, FLAG>>`. The presence of one will result in different `SearchCommand` constructor being called. +
The `SearchCommandParser` will call the both the `OrderContainsKeywordsPredicate` constructor and the `ReturnOrderContainsKeywordsPredicate` if no `<<command_flags, FLAG>>` is given. +
However, if a `<<command_flags, FLAG>>` is given, the corresponding predicate will be instantiated and passed as an parameter for the `SearchCommand` constructor with the other left as null value.

[IMPORTANT]
====
* What is not shown is that optionally, either `OrderContainsKeywordsPredicate` or `ReturnOrderContainsKeywordsPredicate` can be null if a `<<command_flags, FLAG>>` is given. However, under no circumstances should both be null.
====

The parsing of user input utilises `ArgumentTokenzier` (not shown in sequence diagram) to process and split each `KEYWORD` to it's corresponding `<<command_prefix, ORDER_ATTRIBUTE_PREFIX>>`, if given any. +

If the preamble to any `<<command_prefix, ORDER_ATTRIBUTE_PREFIX>>` is not empty, a *general search* will be performed in which `KEYWORD` will be searched through all fields of parcel. +
However, if `<<command_prefix, ORDER_ATTRIBUTE_PREFIX>>` is given and the preamble is empty, the *specific search* will be performed. Only parcel fields that correspond to the given `<<command_prefix, ORDER_ATTRIBUTE_PREFIX>>` will be searched and matched with the `KEYWORD`.

The order and return order list updates automatically as the JavaFX class `ObservableList` is used to listen to any changes.


=== Logging

We are using `java.util.logging` package for logging. The `LogsCenter` class is used to manage the logging levels and logging destinations.

* The logging level can be controlled using the `logLevel` setting in the configuration file (See <<Implementation-Configuration>>)
* The `Logger` for a class can be obtained using `LogsCenter.getLogger(Class)` which will log messages according to the specified logging level
* Currently log messages are output through: `Console` and to a `.log` file.

*Logging Levels*

* `SEVERE` : Critical problem detected which may possibly cause the termination of the application
* `WARNING` : Can continue, but with caution
* `INFO` : Information showing the noteworthy actions by the App
* `FINE` : Details that is not usually noteworthy but may be useful in debugging e.g. print the actual list instead of just its size

[[Implementation-Configuration]]
=== Configuration

Certain properties of the application can be controlled (e.g user prefs file location, logging level) through the configuration file (default: `config.json`).
