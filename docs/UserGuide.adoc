==== How to use the Search command?

Here is how you can `search` for any parcel containing the keywords given by following the steps below: +

*Step 1* : Type in the keyword *search* +
*Step 2* (optional) : Provide `-o` flag if you want to only search for parcels in the order list. A `-r` flag also can be used to only search for parcels in the return list.
[NOTE]
====
If no flag is given in this step, `search` command will be performed on both the order and return list.
====
*Step 3 (optional)* : If you wish to only specifically search for keyword in a field, you should provide the `<<command_prefix, ORDER_ATTRIBUTE_PREFIX>>` coupled with a front slash `/` and the keyword you want to search for. +
*Step 4* : Provide any number of alphanumeric word you wish to search for in the parcel. +
*Step 5* : Press `Enter` on your keyboard to see the magic!

[NOTE]
====
* In between each step please put a whitespace!
* If nothing is displaying means you have no parcel containing the keyword you have given!
====

[[search-examples]]
==== What constitutes a valid Search command?

The syntax for a valid `Search` command can be seen below:

* `search` `<<command_flags, [FLAG]>>` `KEYWORD` `[MORE_KEYWORDS]...` OR
* `search` `<<command_flags, [FLAG]>>` `<<command_prefix, ORDER_ATTRIBUTE_PREFIX>>/KEYWORD` `[MORE_KEYWORDS]...` `[<<command_prefix, ORDER_ATTRIBUTE_PREFIX>>/KEYWORD MORE_KEYWORDS]...`

[NOTE]
====
* `search` is the command word for this feature.
* `FLAG` is to differentiate the different kind of parcel (orders or returns).
* The `KEYWORD` is the word you want to search for in any of the parcel.
* `ORDER_ATTRIBUTE_PREFIX` is the field of the parcel you want to search for
====

.Possible Combinations of Search command
|===
|Scenario |Command |Result

| If you want to search for any return parcel containing the keyword `Jeremy` or `Loh`.
| `search` `-r` `Jeremy Loh` +
| Return all return order(s) containing keyword of `jeremy`, `Jeremy Loh` or `loh` or any of the above as long as it appears in any of the parcel field.

| If you want to search for any order parcel that contain the transaction id of `asj2od3943`.
| `search` `-o` `tid/asj2od3943
| Return all order(s) with transaction ID of `asj2od3943`.

| If you want to search for any return parcel that contain the phone number of `92039999`.
| `search` `-r` `p/92039999`
| Return all return order(s) with phone number of `92039999`

| If you want to only search for any order parcel that contains either the phone number `92039999`, transaction id of `asj2od3943` or the name `jeremy`.
| `search` `-o` `p/92039999` `tid/asj2od3943` `n/jeremy`
| Return all order(s) with either phone number of `92039999` or transaction ID of `asj2od3943` or name of `jeremy` or any of the above combinations.

| If you want to search for any parcel containing the name `Jeremy`
| `search` `n/Jeremy`
| Return all parcel(s) with the name of `Jeremy`
|===

[IMPORTANT]
====
* The search is case insensitive. e.g `hans` will match `Hans`
* The sequence of the keywords does not matter. e.g. `Hans Bo` will match `Bo Hans`
* Only full words will be matched e.g. `Han` will not match `Hans`
* Orders matching at least one keyword will be returned (i.e. `OR` search). e.g. `Hans Bo` will return `Hans Gruber`, `Bo Yang`
