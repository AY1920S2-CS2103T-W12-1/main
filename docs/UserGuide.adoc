`import` is the command and `FILE_NAME`  is the file name that is required to import with the *.csv* extension behind.

[NOTE]
====
* Only CSV file could be imported.
* Only *one* CSV file can be imported at one time.
* The `FILE_NAME` should include the extension. For example: `*orders.csv*`.
* The folder, *data*, which the CSV files are stored in, should be in the same directory as the JAR file.
====

[WARNING]
====
* CSV file should be saved only as CSV (Comma delimited), as shown in the figure below:

.CSV File Save Type

The data in the `CSV file` should be written in the following format:

* Order data format: +
`ot/ORDER_TYPE`, `tid/TRANSACTION_ID`, `n/NAME`, `a/ADDRESS`, `p/PHONE_NUMBER`, `e/EMAIL`, `dts/DELIVERY_DATE_&_TIME`, `w/WAREHOUSE_LOCATION`, `cod/CASH_ON_DELIVERY`, `[c/COMMENTS_BY_CUSTOMER]`, `[type/TYPE_OF_ITEM]`

[NOTE]
====
* Commas `,` are required in between the different fields.
* Prefixes are required before any value for that field.
* `ORDER_TYPE` can only be either `order` or `return`.
* Only `COMMENTS_BY_CUSTOMER` and `TYPE_OF_ITEM` are optional.
* `ORDER_TYPE` denote the start of an delivery order or return order.
* If there are 2 or more `ORDER_TYPE` within a single CSV row, it will be treated as 2 or more orders.
* The last value of the same type will be stored if duplicate prefix type is found in a single order sentence.
* Duplicate and invalid order or return order will not be imported into Delino.

[[search]]
=== Searching for parcels using their attributes: `search` [Done by Kenny Ho Si Chong]
In this section, you will be able to find out how to properly <<search-works, use>> the `search` command and the relevant <<search-examples, examples>>. +
Why will you want to use the `search` command? If you wish to search for a parcel with specific keywords, the `search` command will provide you the means to do so.


[[search-works]]
==== How to use the Search command?

Here is how you can search for any parcel containing the keywords given by the following steps below: +

*Step 1* : Type in the keyword `search` +
*Step 2 (optional)* : Provide `-o` flag if you want to only search for parcels in the order list. A `-r` flag also can be used to only search for parcels in the return order list.

[NOTE]
====
If no flag is given in this step, `search` command will be performed on both the order and return order list.
====
*Step 3 (optional)* : If you wish to only specifically search for keywords in a field, you should provide the `<<command_prefix, ORDER_ATTRIBUTE_PREFIX>>` coupled with a front slash `/` and the keyword you want to search for. +
*Step 4* : Provide any number of alphanumeric words you wish to search for in the parcel. +
*Step 5* : Press `Enter` on your keyboard to see the magic!

[NOTE]
====
* In between each step please put a whitespace!
* If nothing is displaying means you have no parcel containing the keyword you have given!
* Keyword searches are case-insensitive, e.g: `Jeremy` matches `jErEmY` or `jeremy` or any alphabet casing permutations.
====

[[search-examples]]
==== What constitutes a valid Search command?

The syntax for a valid `search` command can be seen below:

* `search` `[<<command_flags, FLAG>>]` `KEYWORD` `[MORE_KEYWORDS]...` OR
* `search` `[<<command_flags, FLAG>>]` `<<command_prefix, ORDER_ATTRIBUTE_PREFIX>>/KEYWORD` `[MORE_KEYWORDS]...` `[<<command_prefix, ORDER_ATTRIBUTE_PREFIX>>/KEYWORD]` `[MORE_KEYWORDS]...`

[NOTE]
====
* `search` is the command word for this feature.
* `FLAG` is to differentiate the different kind of parcel (orders or returns).
* The `KEYWORD` is the word you want to search for in any of the parcel and it is case-insensitive.
* `ORDER_ATTRIBUTE_PREFIX` is the field of the parcel you want to search for
====

These are the possible combinations of the `search` command:

.Possible Combinations of Search command
|===
|Scenario |Command |Result

| If you want to search for any return parcel containing the keyword `Jeremy` or `Loh`.
| `search` `-r` `Jeremy Loh` +
| Return all return order(s) containing keyword of `jeremy`, `Jeremy Loh` or `loh` or any of the above as long as it appears in any of the parcel field.

| If you want to search for any order parcel that contain the transaction id of `asj2od3943`.
| `search` `-o` `tid/asj2od3943`
| Return all order(s) with transaction ID of `asj2od3943`.

| If you want to search for any return parcel that contain the phone number of `92039999`.
| `search` `-r` `p/92039999`
| Return all return order(s) with phone number of `92039999`

| If you want to only search for any order parcel that contains either the phone number `92039999`, transaction id of `asj2od3943` or the name `jeremy`.
| `search` `-o` `p/92039999` `tid/asj2od3943` `n/jeremy`
| Return all order(s) with either phone number of `92039999` or transaction ID of `asj2od3943` or name of `jeremy` or any of the above combinations.

| If you want to search for *any* parcel containing the name `Jeremy`.
| `search` `n/Jeremy`
| Return all parcel(s) with the name of `Jeremy`
|===

[IMPORTANT]
====
* The search is case insensitive. e.g `hans` will match `Hans`
* The sequence of the keywords does not matter. e.g. `Hans Bo` will match `Bo Hans`
* Only full words will be matched e.g. `Han` will not match `Hans`
* Orders matching at least one keyword will be returned (i.e. `OR` search). e.g. `Hans Bo` will return `Hans Gruber`, `Bo Yang`
