== PROJECT: Delino

---

== Overview

Delino is a desktop application for couriers to manage delivery tasks. The user
interacts with it using a CLI, and it has a GUI created with JavaFX. It is written in Java and has about 10 kLoC.

== Summary of contributions

* *Major enhancement*:
Added the `help` command (Pull requests: https://github.com/AY1920S2-CS2103T-W12-1/main/pull/310[#310])
** What it does: It displays a list of all Delino's commands
** Justification: This command allows the user to see the usage of each command in Delino and
quickly be able to utilise Delino's available features.

** Added `return` command (Pull request: )
*** What it does: This command allows the user to create a new return order and add it into the Return Order List or
convert a delivered order into a return order
and add it into the Return Order List.
*** Justification: This feature is a must-have in Delino as it is a delivery management app. It allows the user to convert
delivered orders into return orders and even create new return orders from scratch with the given parcel attributes.
This feature requires a deep understanding of the AddressBook 3 (AB3) codebase and that took quite a bit of time.
Two different logic execution paths had to be implemented and the testing of this feature also had to be extensive
and exhaustive to ensure that no test cases were missed in the process of testing.

** Added `delivered` command (Pull request: )
*** What it does: Allows the user to mark orders or return orders as delivered.
*** Justification: This is an important feature and it is a must-have for an app like Delino. It allows the user to easily
mark an order or return order as delivered after delivering the parcel.
