== Summary of contributions

* *Major enhancement*:
** Added `insert` command (Pull request https://github.com/AY1920S2-CS2103T-W12-1/main/pull/189[#189])
*** What it does: Allows the user to insert new delivery order into the Order List.
*** Justification: This is an important feature and it is a must-have. It allows user to insert multiple orders into
the list.


** Refactor the `list` command (Pull request https://github.com/AY1920S2-CS2103T-W12-1/main/pull/239[#239])
*** What it does: Instead of simply displaying all the orders, the user can choose to list : +
**** Delivered orders
**** Undelivered orders
*** Justification: The feature helps the user, as a courier, to know how many orders have to be completed and how many orders
are already completed.

** Added the `show` command (Pull request https://github.com/AY1920S2-CS2103T-W12-1/main/pull/199[#199])
*** What it does: It gives a more detailed information about the orders and return orders in their lists, in the form
of numbers and PieChart. The information shown is : +
**** Total Earnings
**** Orders Completed
**** Orders Returned
**** A PieChart to show to the user on how many orders are completed and not completed, returned and not returned.
** *Highlights*: +
Ability to let user to see information based on the date(s) provided. For example, the user can enter :
`show` `2020-02-02` `2020-09-01` to see all the information about the orders that are from the date `2020-02-02`
up to the date `2020-09-01`. In addition, user can show statistics about everything in all the lists or just
simply showing the statistics for today.

*** What it does: Restricts user from entering any invalid values
*** Justification: This is an essential update, as the invalid values will affect the rest of the features.
