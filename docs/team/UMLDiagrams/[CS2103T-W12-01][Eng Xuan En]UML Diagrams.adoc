* *Import Feature UML Diagrams* +

image::ImportActivityDiagram.svg[width=60%]
This Activity Diagram purpose is to describe the general work flow of the Import feature. This diagram is especially
useful for users, as it give them a general work flow of how Import command works and what they should expect out of
Delino when performing a Import command.

image::ImportClassDiagram.svg[width=50%]
This Class Diagram purpose is to describe the dependencies of ImportCommand class when implementing this feature.
This diagram is essential to our Delino application because it allows developer or users who are interested to better
understand the underlying dependencies of ImportCommand class.

image::ImportCommandSequenceDiagram.svg[width=60%]
image::ExecuteImportCommand.svg[width=55%]
This Sequence Diagram shows a more detailed explanation of the communication between the different classes used in
the Logic and Model after the user execute the `import` command. This would allows the user to further understand how
ImportCommand works after `import` Command being executed.

* *Clear Feature UML Diagram*

image::ClearActivityDiagram.svg[width=60%]
The purpose of this Activity Diagram is to describe the general work flow of the Clear feature.
This diagram is especially useful for users, as it give them a general work flow of how Clear command works and what
they should expect out of Delino when performing a Clear command.

image::ClearCommandClassDiagram.svg[width=50%]
This Class Diagram purpose is to describe the dependencies of SearchCommand class when implementing this feature.
This diagram is essential to our Delino application because it allows developer or users who are interested to better
understand the underlying dependencies of SearchCommand class.

image::ClearCommandSequenceDiagram.svg[width=50%]
image::ExecuteClearCommand.svg[width=50%]
The two Sequence Diagram shows a more detailed explanation of the communication between the Logic and Model class of
Delino when the `clear` command is being executed. During the parsing of ClearCommandParser, it will check if the flags
in the arguments are valid and whether if both `-r` and `-o` flags found in the arguments which will throws
ParseException if it fails the checks. This allows the user to be able to understand how the ClearCommand works after
executing the `clear` Command.

* *Storage Class UML Diagram*

image::StorageClassDiagram.svg[width=50%]
This Class Diagram purpose is to give a overview of a storage system in Delino, whereby StorageManager is interacting
with Logic Manager through the interface, Storage. This is essential to Delino, as it allows the developer or users
who are interested to better understand the relationship between StorageManager and the other storage class.
