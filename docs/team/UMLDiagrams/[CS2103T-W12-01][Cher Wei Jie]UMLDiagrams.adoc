* *Return Features UML Diagrams*

image::../../images/ReturnCommandActivityDiagram.png[width=40%]
This Activity Diagram purpose is to describe the general work flow of the Return feature.

image::../../images/ReturnClassDiagram.png[width=40%]
This Class Diagram purpose is to describe the dependencies of `ReturnCommand`
class when implementing this feature. It allows a developer to easily see the
classes and interfaces associated with the `ReturnCommand`.

image::../../images/ReturnSequenceDiagram1_a.png[width=40%]
image::../../images/ReturnSequenceDiagram1_b.png[width=40%]
The first Sequence Diagram depicts a simple overview of the entire execution flow of a valid
`return` command for converting a delivered order into a return order. The second Sequence Diagram depicts a simple overview of the entire execution flow of a valid
`return` command for creating a new return order based on given parcel attributes.

image::../../images/ReturnSequenceDiagram2_a.png[width=40%]
image::../../images/ReturnSequenceDiagram2_b.png[width=40%]
The third Sequence Diagram depicts a detailed execution flow of a valid
`return` command for converting a order into a return order. The fourth Sequence Diagram depicts
a detailed execution flow of a valid `return` command for creating a new return order and
this will throw an exception and display an error message to the user if any compulsory parcel
attribute is missing.

* *Delivered Features UML Diagram*

image::../../images/DeliveredCommandActivityDiagram.png[width=40%]
This Activity Diagram purpose is to describe the general work flow of the Delivered feature.

image::../../images/DeliveredClassDiagram.png[width=40%]
This Class Diagram purpose is to describe the dependencies of `DeliveredCommand`
class when implementing this feature. It allows a developer to easily see the
classes and interfaces associated with the `DeliveredCommand`.

image::../../images/DeliveredSequenceDiagram.png[width=40%]
This Sequence Diagram depicts a simple overview of the entire execution flow of a valid
`delivered` command for marking an order or return order as delivered.

image::../../images/DeliveredSequenceDiagram2.png[width=40%]
This Sequence Diagram depicts a detailed execution flow of a valid
`delivered` command for delivering an order and this will throw an exception and display an error
message to the user if the `FLAG` and/or the `INDEX` is/are invalid or missing. If both `FLAG` and `INDEX` are valid, the `delivered` command will update the respective order or return
order list (depending on the provided `FLAG`) and display the success message to the user in the GUI.

diagram of Help Command.
