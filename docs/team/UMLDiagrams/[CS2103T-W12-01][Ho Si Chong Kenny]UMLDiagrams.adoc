* *Edit Features UML Diagrams*

image::../../images/EditCommandActivityDiagram.svg[width=50%]
This Activity Diagram purpose is to describe the general work flow of the Edit feature.
This is essential to the project as it allows first time developer or user to know the expected outcome once edit is being performed.

image::../../images/EditCommandClassDiagram.png[width=70%]
This Class Diagram purpose is to describe the dependencies of EditCommand class when implementing this feature.
This diagram allows developers who are interested in developing or maintaining Delino to better understand the structure of EditCommand faster.

image::../../images/EditCommandSequenceDiagram.svg[width=100%]
This Sequence Diagram is to show a more detailed explanation of the communication between the Logic and Model class of Delino once an execution of edit command is performed. +
This diagram help developers or users allows developers or users who are interested to further understand the implementation of Edit command and allow them to use it as a reference to further develop this feature in the future.
