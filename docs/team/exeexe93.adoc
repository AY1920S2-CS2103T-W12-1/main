== Summary of contributions

|===
|_Given below are the summary of the contributions I have made for this project._
|===

* *Major enhancement*:
** Added `import` command (Pull request https://github.com/AY1920S2-CS2103T-W12-1/main/pull/215[#215])
*** What it does: Allows the user to add multiple orders and return orders via a CSV file.
*** Justification: This is an essential update, which allows the user to save time +
from adding multiple orders and return order one by one.

** Add return order book for storage (Pull request https://github.com/AY1920S2-CS2103T-W12-1/main/pull/186[#186])
*** What it does: Stores return orders.
*** Justification: The storage of return orders is important, as the return orders are required to be separate from
orders and store as a separate json file in the hard disk from the orders.

** Modify the `clear` command (Pull requests https://github.com/AY1920S2-CS2103T-W12-1/main/pull/180[#180], https://github.com/AY1920S2-CS2103T-W12-1/main/pull/218[#218])
*** What it does: Gives the user three options to clear:
**** Only order list
**** Only return order list
**** Both order list and return order list
*** Justification: This is an essential update, which prevent the user from having the trouble clearing the orders or return orders one by one.

* *Minor enhancement*:
** Add `timestamp` field into the model(Pull requests https://github.com/AY1920S2-CS2103T-W12-1/main/pull/175[#175], https://github.com/AY1920S2-CS2103T-W12-1/main/pull/198[#198])
*** What it does: Allows orders and return orders to keep track of the delivery date and time.
*** Justification: This is an essential update, which allows user to input timestamp for the order and return order.

** Add `comment` field into the model(Pull request https://github.com/AY1920S2-CS2103T-W12-1/main/pull/172[#172])
*** What it does: Allows orders and return orders to store customer comment.
*** Justification: This is an essential update, which allows the courier to be able to take note about +
the customer's request, such as sending a message to notify the customer that the courier will be sending +
their parcel on that day.
