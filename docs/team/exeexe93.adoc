== Summary of contributions

|===
|_Given below are the summary of the contributions I have made for this project._
|===

* *Major enhancement*:
** Added `import` command (Pull request https://github.com/AY1920S2-CS2103T-W12-1/main/pull/215[#215])
*** What it does: Allows the user to add multiple orders and return orders via a CSV file.
*** Justification: This is an essential update, which allows the user to save time from adding multiple orders and
return order one by one.
*** Highlights: This enhancement depends heavily on `InsertCommandParser` and `ReturnCommandParser` to process the data
retrieve from the data. Considerations have to be made to differentiate the data for `Order` and `ReturnOrder`, as they
have different attributes in their models.

** Add return order book for storage (Pull request https://github.com/AY1920S2-CS2103T-W12-1/main/pull/186[#186])
*** What it does: Stores return orders in json file.
*** Justification: The storage of return orders is important, as the return orders are required to be separate from
orders and store as a separate json file in the hard disk from the orders.
*** Highlights: Considerations are to be made for how to store and retrieve the return order data from the json file
which is stored in hard disk.

** Modify the `clear` command (Pull requests https://github.com/AY1920S2-CS2103T-W12-1/main/pull/180[#180], https://github.com/AY1920S2-CS2103T-W12-1/main/pull/218[#218])
*** What it does: Gives the user to clear either both order lists or only one of them.
*** Justification: This is an essential update, which prevent the user from having the trouble clearing the orders or return orders one by one.
*** Highlights: Considerations are to be made for the clearing either one of the list or both order list and return order list,
as clearing the wrong list, the data in that list would be lost permanently.

* *Minor enhancement*:
** Add `timestamp` field into the model(Pull requests https://github.com/AY1920S2-CS2103T-W12-1/main/pull/175[#175], https://github.com/AY1920S2-CS2103T-W12-1/main/pull/198[#198])
*** What it does: Allows orders and return orders to keep track of the delivery date and time.
*** Justification: This is an essential update, which allows user to input timestamp for the order and return order.

** Add `comment` field into the model(Pull request https://github.com/AY1920S2-CS2103T-W12-1/main/pull/172[#172])
*** What it does: Allows orders and return orders to store customer comment.
*** Justification: This is an essential update, which allows the courier to be able to take note about
the customer's request for that delivery.
