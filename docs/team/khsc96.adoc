== PROJECT: Delino

---

== Overview

Delino is a desktop application for couriers to manage delivery tasks. The user
interacts with it using a CLI, and it has a GUI created with JavaFX. It is written in Java, and has about 10 kLoC.

== Summary of contributions

* *Major enhancement*:

. *Added `search` feature* (Pull request https://github.com/AY1920S2-CS2103T-W12-1/main/pull/187[#187]) +
Functionality of feature can be found <<../UserGuide.adoc#search, here>> and implementation of it can be found <<../DeveloperGuide.adoc#search, here>>.

*** *What it does*: +
Allows the user to specifically search for keywords that matches any fields of the parcel. The user are also able to narrow down their search range by providing different flags and prefixes.

*** *Justification*: +
This is one of the key feature of Delino as it allows the user to sieve out parcels of their interest from the large parcels list.

*** *Highlights*: +
This enhancement is affected by the existing `insert` and `return` command as it depends heavily on the fields added in parcel.
It also affects the future command to be added in if the future command requires to change the properties of a parcel. Implementing this feature requires
the thorough understanding of the existing class in AB3 such as the `ArgumentMultimap` and the `NameContainsKeywordsPredicate`. Furthermore, JavaFX class `Predicate` was used to achieve functionality of this feature. +
Moreover, as this features allows user to search in many different possible way, testing the different scenarios are hard. ParametizedTest of JUnit testing was used to make my test code much cleaner.

. *Updated `edit` feature* (Pull request https://github.com/AY1920S2-CS2103T-W12-1/main/pull/234[#234]) +
Functionality of feature can be found <<../UserGuide.adoc#edit, here>> and implementation of it can be found <<../DeveloperGuide.adoc#edit,here>>.

*** *What it does*: +
Allows the user to edit specific fields of a parcel, Order or Return Order.

*** *Justification*: +
This is one of the key feature of Delino as it allows the user to edit any field in Orders or Return Orders. It is especially important as the user might need to reschedule the delivery date due to unforeseen circumstances.

*** *Highlights*: +
This enhancement is affected by the design of parcel class. It affects the future implementation of any future features that will alter the parcel design.
This feature requires a thorough understanding of the existing code of AB3 such as the `ArgumentMultimap` class.

* *Minor enhancement*: +
